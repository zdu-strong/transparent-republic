The central government collects taxes centrally and allocates 30% of the tax revenue from each state to the states.<br/>
If a state deems 30% insufficient, it must submit a detailed budget for review by its finance team, after which additional funds will be allocated.<br/>
States have full control over their finances, and the central government cannot interfere.<br/>
Taxes include consumption tax, property tax, and income tax.<br/>
