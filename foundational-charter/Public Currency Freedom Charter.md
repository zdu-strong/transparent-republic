Transparent Republic Public Currency Freedom Charter<br/>

Chapter: Lumen - A Free Currency Exchange System<br/>

Lumen is the decentralized, trust-backed currency exchange system created by Transparent Republic. It enables seamless, permissionless conversion between supported currencies ‚Äî without fees, borders, or discrimination.<br/>

"Lumen doesn't belong to a bank. It belongs to humanity."<br/>

üìà System Overview<br/>

The Free Currency System is divided into three modes:<br/>

‚ñ∂ Contribution Mode:<br/>

Users contribute two supported currencies.<br/>

Contributions are automatically converted into Central Currency Units (CCUs).<br/>

Contributions can be withdrawn at any time, with CCUs converted back into chosen currencies based on real-time exchange rates.<br/>

‚ñ∂ Exchange Mode:<br/>

Allows conversion from one currency into another.<br/>

The system calculates the required CCUs and executes the exchange automatically.<br/>

‚ñ∂ Trade Mode:<br/>

Allows users to select both payment currency and accepted currency.<br/>

üìä Key Design Elements<br/>

Supported Currencies:<br/>

Only currencies reviewed and approved by Transparent Republic are supported.<br/>

Central Currency Unit (CCU):<br/>

Not a real-world currency.<br/>

Visible only to contributors.<br/>

Acts as a neutral anchor to calculate relative exchange rates between real currencies.<br/>

Users may choose between a fixed CCU amount display or floating real-time equivalent value.<br/>

‚öñÔ∏è Dynamic Exchange Logic (Example Walkthrough)<br/>

Let us assume:<br/>

Contributor A deposits:<br/>

50 TRC (Transparent Republic Coins)<br/>

500 USD<br/>

Contributor A receives:<br/>

1000 CCUs<br/>

System pool now contains:<br/>

500 CCUs (50 TRC)<br/>

500 CCUs (500 USD)<br/>

Contributor B deposits:<br/>

50 TRC(500CCUs)<br/>

500 USD(500ccus)<br/>

Contributor B receives:<br/>

1000 CCUs<br/>

System pool now contains:<br/>

1000 CCUs (100 TRC)<br/>

1000 CCUs (1000 USD)<br/>

Contributor C deposits:<br/>

1000 TRC(CCUs)<br/>

100 USD(CCUs)<br/>

Contributor C receives:<br/>

2000 CCUs<br/>

System pool now contains:<br/>

2000 CCUs (1100 TRC)<br/>

2000 CCUs (1100 USD)<br/>

A user exchanges 100 TRC to USD:<br/>

100 TRC converts into 125,000 CCUs<br/>

Converted into 150 USD<br/>

System pool becomes:<br/>

250,000 CCUs (300 TRC)<br/>

250,000 CCUs (150 USD)<br/>

This dynamic ratio determines exchange rate responsiveness without needing national currency reserves or market intervention. Users themselves become co-regulators of value, incentivizing equilibrium through behavior.<br/>

üåç Governance Principles<br/>

Transparency<br/>

Inclusiveness<br/>

Revocability<br/>

Currency diversity protection<br/>

Public trust and governance oversight<br/>

Lumen is not just a system. It's a symbol of economic dignity. A future where money no longer divides us, but connects us.<br/>
