Transparent Republic Public Currency Freedom Charter<br/>

Chapter: Lumen - A Free Currency Exchange System<br/>

Lumen is the decentralized, trust-backed currency exchange system created by Transparent Republic.<br/>
It enables seamless, permissionless conversion between supported currencies â€” without fees, borders, or discrimination.<br/>

ðŸ’¬ "Lumen doesn't belong to a bank. It belongs to humanity."<br/>



System Overview<br/>

The Free Currency System is divided into three modes:<br/>

Contribution Mode:<br/>

Users contribute two supported currencies.<br/>

Contributions are automatically converted into Central Currency Units (CCUs).<br/>

Contributions can be withdrawn at any time, with CCUs converted back into chosen currencies based on real-time exchange rates.<br/>

Exchange Mode:<br/>

Allows conversion from one currency into another.<br/>

The system calculates the required CCUs and executes the exchange automatically.<br/>

Trade Mode:<br/>

Allows users to select both payment currency and accepted currency.<br/>

Key Design Elements<br/>

Supported Currencies: Only currencies reviewed and approved by Transparent Republic are supported.<br/>

Central Currency Unit (CCU):<br/>

Not a real-world currency.<br/>

Visible only to contributors.<br/>

Acts as a neutral anchor to calculate relative exchange rates between real currencies.<br/>

Users may choose between a fixed CCU amount display or floating real-time equivalent value.<br/>

Dynamic Exchange Logic (Example Walkthrough)<br/>

Let us assume:<br/>

Contributor A deposits:<br/>

10 TRC (Transparent Republic Coins)<br/>

100 USD<br/>

10,000 JPY<br/>

Each of these contributions earns 100,000 CCUs respectively.<br/>

System pool now contains:<br/>

100,000 CCUs (TRC)<br/>

100,000 CCUs (USD)<br/>

100,000 CCUs (JPY)<br/>

A user wishes to exchange 10 TRC to USD:<br/>

10 TRC converts into 100,000 CCUs<br/>

Converted into 100 USD<br/>

System pool becomes:<br/>

200,000 CCUs (TRC)<br/>

100,000 CCUs (JPY)<br/>

Another user exchanges 10 TRC to JPY:<br/>

10 TRC â†’ 100,000 CCUs â†’ 10,000 JPY<br/>

Pool: 300,000 CCUs (TRC)<br/>

New contributions:<br/>

Contributor B adds 10 TRC + 50 USD â†’ 100,000 CCUs each<br/>

Contributor C adds 10 TRC + 100 USD â†’ 100,000 CCUs each<br/>

Updated pool:<br/>

500,000 CCUs (TRC)<br/>

200,000 CCUs (USD)<br/>

A user converts 10 TRC to USD:<br/>

10 TRC â†’ 100,000 CCUs â†’ 75 USD<br/>

Final Pool:<br/>

400,000 CCUs (TRC)<br/>

100,000 CCUs (USD)<br/>

This dynamic ratio determines exchange rate responsiveness without needing national currency reserves or market intervention. Users themselves become co-regulators of value, incentivizing equilibrium through behavior.<br/>

This system shall be maintained under the principles of:<br/>

Transparency<br/>

Inclusiveness<br/>

Revocability<br/>

Currency diversity protection<br/>

Public trust and governance oversight<br/>
