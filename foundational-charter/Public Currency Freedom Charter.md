Transparent Republic Public Currency Freedom Charter

Chapter: Lumen - A Free Currency Exchange System

To uphold global economic liberty and cross-border cooperation, the Transparent Republic hereby establishes a structured and publicly accountable Free Currency Exchange System, supported and supervised by the state. This system is grounded in dynamic public participation, responsible financial logic, and complete transparency.

System Overview

The Free Currency System is divided into three modes:

Contribution Mode:

Users contribute two supported currencies.

Contributions are automatically converted into Central Currency Units (CCUs).

Contributions can be withdrawn at any time, with CCUs converted back into chosen currencies based on real-time exchange rates.

Exchange Mode:

Allows conversion from one currency into another.

The system calculates the required CCUs and executes the exchange automatically.

Trade Mode:

Allows users to select both payment currency and accepted currency.

Key Design Elements

Supported Currencies: Only currencies reviewed and approved by Transparent Republic are supported.

Central Currency Unit (CCU):

Not a real-world currency.

Visible only to contributors.

Acts as a neutral anchor to calculate relative exchange rates between real currencies.

Users may choose between a fixed CCU amount display or floating real-time equivalent value.

Dynamic Exchange Logic (Example Walkthrough)

Let us assume:

Contributor A deposits:

10 TRC (Transparent Republic Coins)

100 USD

10,000 JPY

Each of these contributions earns 100,000 CCUs respectively.

System pool now contains:

100,000 CCUs (TRC)

100,000 CCUs (USD)

100,000 CCUs (JPY)

A user wishes to exchange 10 TRC to USD:

10 TRC converts into 100,000 CCUs

Converted into 100 USD

System pool becomes:

200,000 CCUs (TRC)

100,000 CCUs (JPY)

Another user exchanges 10 TRC to JPY:

10 TRC → 100,000 CCUs → 10,000 JPY

Pool: 300,000 CCUs (TRC)

New contributions:

Contributor B adds 10 TRC + 50 USD → 100,000 CCUs each

Contributor C adds 10 TRC + 100 USD → 100,000 CCUs each

Updated pool:

500,000 CCUs (TRC)

200,000 CCUs (USD)

A user converts 10 TRC to USD:

10 TRC → 100,000 CCUs → 75 USD

Final Pool:

400,000 CCUs (TRC)

100,000 CCUs (USD)

This dynamic ratio determines exchange rate responsiveness without needing national currency reserves or market intervention. Users themselves become co-regulators of value, incentivizing equilibrium through behavior.

This system shall be maintained under the principles of:

Transparency

Inclusiveness

Revocability

Currency diversity protection

Public trust and governance oversight
