📜 Basic Price Charter
of the Transparent Republic
Version 1.0

🌐 Preamble:
In the Transparent Republic, liberty is sacred.
Yet freedom without a floor is vulnerable to collapse.
This charter is not an act of control, but a structure of compassion — carefully limited, deliberately restrained.

🧱 Article I: Purpose
The Basic Price Charter exists to:

Protect the right of every citizen to live with dignity.

Prevent exploitative pricing of essential goods and services.

Maintain economic transparency in times of peace and crisis.

It is not designed to engineer equality, nor to interfere with innovation or voluntary simplicity.

🧺 Article II: Scope of Protection
The following essential goods and services fall under this charter:

Basic staple food (rice, bread, eggs, vegetables)

Clean drinking water

Electricity and heating for primary residence

Public education (through age 18)

Emergency healthcare services

Public transportation for urban access

Minimum shelter (as defined by local councils)

For these items, the Charter establishes:

Minimum procurement price to prevent abuse of small producers.

Maximum retail price to protect public access and dignity.

Public cost calculation models, regularly updated and open-sourced.

🧾 Article III: Exclusions and Autonomy
The following are explicitly excluded from the Basic Price Charter:

All luxury goods and premium services

All non-essential economic sectors

All independent merchants (individuals or family-run businesses not registered as corporations or cooperatives)

Individual freedom shall not be sacrificed for structural kindness.
Independent communities may operate on trust and barter, and the Republic shall not intrude upon that sacred autonomy.

🚨 Article IV: Emergency Clause
In times of declared national crisis (natural disaster, war, epidemic), the Transparent Republic may:

Activate Emergency Supply Corridors

Deploy National Resource Units to affected zones

Temporarily stabilize prices via emergency public outlets

This is done without suppressing individual trade, ensuring that liberty and survival are never in conflict.

🧮 Article V: Governance and Transparency
All price floors and ceilings shall be proposed by the Fiscal Approval Team,
reviewed by the National Oversight Committee,
and finalized via citizen referendum every 12 months.

All data sources, economic models, and deliberation logs must be publicly accessible.

🤝 Article VI: Review and Revocation
Any product or service may be added or removed from this Charter via:

Citizen petition (10,000 signatures minimum)

Transparent debate and vote process

Annual charter review period (conducted every March)

🧭 Article VII: Philosophy Statement
This Charter is not a safety net for comfort,
but a foundation for survival with dignity.
It shall never grow so wide as to trap freedom,
nor so narrow as to forsake the vulnerable.

We are not here to regulate gratitude.
We are here to protect the right to rise.
— Transparent Republic
