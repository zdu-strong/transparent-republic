# 🕊️ Foundational Price Charter  
*A living commitment to dignity, stability, and a civilization worth living in*  

---

## 📜 Preamble

In this age of abundance and automation, no human being should suffer due to scarcity that is artificially maintained or systemically ignored.  
The Foundational Price Charter is a constitutional guarantee — that **no one** shall be priced out of survival.

> This is not welfare.  
> This is not charity.  
> This is **dignity made law**.

## 🏠 Article I – Right to Exist Without Fear

Every citizen, regardless of employment status, age, or social class, shall be guaranteed access to:

- Clean water  
- Nutritious food  
- Basic housing  
- Primary healthcare  
- Public education  
- Safe energy  
- Essential communication (e.g., internet access)

These are **non-negotiable**, not subject to market speculation, and shall never be withheld as tools of control.

## ⚖️ Article II – Price Stability Through State Regulation

The government shall define and maintain **foundational prices** — the fair, maximum prices for all essential goods and services listed in Article I.

- These prices are **not allowed to exceed** a defined threshold, regardless of global market pressures.  
- State-owned or publicly regulated entities shall **provide fallback access** to these essentials if private markets fail or manipulate supply.

## 🛡️ Article III – Transparent Republic Enforcement

Under the Transparent Republic system:

- **Community Supervisors** oversee local access and fairness;  
- The **National Supervisory Council** monitors supply chains, adjusts prices, and prevents corruption;  
- **Citizens** have the right to audit, report abuse, and propose amendments through **transparent, participatory democracy**.

## 🌱 Article IV – Innovation Above Survival

The Charter ensures survival so that human energy can be spent not in fear, but in **creation, connection, and contribution**.

With the fear of poverty erased, a civilization of artists, scientists, builders, and dreamers shall rise.

## 🔐 Article V – This Charter Shall Be Immutable in Spirit

Governments may change.  
Technologies may evolve.  
But **this Charter must outlive politics** — its spirit shall remain untouched, unless expanded further in favor of dignity and humanity.

## ✨ Conclusion

This is not just a document.  
It is a promise to every child born into this world:

> “You will never have to earn the right to be alive.”

And that is where true civilization begins.
