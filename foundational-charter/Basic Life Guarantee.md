🏛️ Basic Survival Dividend
Principle:

Every person deserves to live—not because of what they do,
but simply because they exist.

Therefore, the Transparent Republic provides every individual living within the territory with a universal, unconditional starting income—a foundational amount granted equally to all.

📌 Disbursement Method:

Delivered in monetary form directly to individual accounts.

No proof of employment, no nationality requirement.

Not reduced or canceled based on income, assets, or age.

Distributed monthly or weekly, with standards periodically adjusted by the National Supervisory Council to maintain purchasing power.

💬 This is not only a welfare program. It is a declaration of dignity.
