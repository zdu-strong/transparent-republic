📜 Chapter 1: Basic Life Guarantee
🌱 Core Principle
Every life deserves a minimum level of dignity.
A civilization should not rely on fear and deprivation as its primary engine of progress.

📌 Scope
Every individual residing within the nation—regardless of citizenship, legal status, or past actions—is entitled to:

Basic nourishment (locally defined affordable food standards)

Clean drinking water

Shelter (shared or personal, depending on need and availability)

Basic medical care (to preserve life and prevent suffering)

Physical safety and protection

Access to electricity and essential energy

Minimal communication access (to remain connected to society)

🔒 Non-citizens are entitled only to life-preserving and dignity-sustaining minimums—not luxury or civil privileges.

🏛️ Chapter 2: Sovereign Dividend
🌟 Core Principle
The people are not beggars.
They are the sovereign owners of their nation.
This payment is not charity—it is a direct return on ownership.

💡 Eligibility
Reserved exclusively for citizens

Unconditional: no work or tax required to receive it

May be proportionally adjusted based on civic participation, community service, or long-term residence (subject to future public deliberation)

💰 Funding Sources
Corporate taxes

Wealth taxes

Land use and national asset dividends

Automation, carbon, digital, or future tech-derived taxes

Once the state’s essential functions and reserves are funded, all remaining public surplus becomes Sovereign Dividend.

💬 Symbolic Meaning
It redefines social payments as respect, not pity.

Democracy becomes tangible—not just a right, but a shared return.

Every time it is issued, it whispers to the citizen:

“You are the owner of this country.”

🔁 Cyclical Impact
Encourages political participation (caring = more dividends)

Reduces violence and crime (no need for coercion)

Helps businesses recruit aligned talent (basic needs are met)

Politics becomes a system of distributing ownership, not a game of control
