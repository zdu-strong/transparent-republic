# Voluntary Declaration<br/>
Within 3 days of receiving a bribe, the recipient voluntarily declares it.<br/>
The funds are legally converted into private property and no tax is required.<br/>

# Failure to Declare<br/>
If the bribe is not declared within 3 days of receipt, once discovered, a fine equal to 100% of the amount is imposed.<br/>
If the fine is not paid within 3 months, bankruptcy liquidation is initiated.<br/>
If the fine is still unpaid after liquidation, a Public Restriction Penalty is imposed.<br/>
If the Public Restriction Penalty is not accepted, imprisonment follows.<br/>
