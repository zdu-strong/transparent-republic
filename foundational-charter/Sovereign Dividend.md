🏛️ Sovereign Dividend<br/>

A Guaranteed Return for the True Owners of the Nation<br/>


---

🔹 Principle<br/>

The people are the sovereign owners of their nation.<br/>
The Sovereign Dividend is a direct return on ownership—not welfare, but rightful inheritance.<br/>


---

🔹 Eligibility<br/>

Reserved exclusively for citizens<br/>

Unconditional: No employment or tax contribution required<br/>

Equal: Every citizen receives the same amount<br/>



---

🔹 Funding Sources<br/>

Corporate taxes<br/>

Wealth taxes<br/>

Land use fees and national asset dividends<br/>

Taxes on automation, carbon, digital platforms, or future technologies<br/>

Once the state's essential functions and strategic reserves are funded, all remaining public surplus is redistributed as Sovereign Dividend<br/>



---

💬 Symbolic Meaning<br/>

Democracy becomes tangible—not just a right, but a shared return.<br/>
Every time it is issued, it whispers to the citizen:<br/>

> “You are the owner of this country.”<br/>

📅 Annual Distribution Mechanism<br/>


---

1️⃣ At the Start of Each Fiscal Year<br/>

The National Supervisory Council sets a target dividend amount per citizen for the coming year, based on projected revenues, inflation, and living standards.<br/>

This amount is included as a core item in the national budget—equal in priority to healthcare, education, and infrastructure.<br/>



---

2️⃣ If Revenue Falls Short<br/>

The government must not reduce the dividend.<br/>

It must transparently issue public bonds or loans to fulfill the dividend commitment.<br/>

All borrowing activities are overseen and reported by the National Supervisory Council.<br/>



---

3️⃣ At the End of the Year<br/>

The full dividend is issued as promised.<br/>

If there is surplus revenue, it is added to the dividend pool and distributed as a bonus dividend.<br/>

This encourages efficient budgeting and aligns citizens' interests with state performance.<br/>



---

🧭 Democratic Impact<br/>

Citizens can view their tax contribution vs. dividend return in a public portal.<br/>

Enhances tax morale—people know their money benefits everyone, including themselves.<br/>

Shifts the psychology from “I give to the state” to “I invest in the public.”<br/>
